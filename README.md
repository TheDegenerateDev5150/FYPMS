# FYPMS

NTU AY2022/23 Semester 2 SC2002 Group Project - Final Year Project Management System (FYPMS).

Final Year Project Management System (FYPMS) is a Java console application that utilizes object-oriented concepts to efficiently manage final year project settings. The program is designed with a focus on reusability, extensibility, and maintainability, allowing for easy upgrades and future development. It provides flexibility to accommodate different user types and their requirements.

## Highlights
- Reflection: The interface `Model` uses reflection to convert between classes and strings, enabling dynamic handling of model data without manual mapping.
- Generic Repository Class: `Repository<Model>` class with generics allows for flexible data storage and retrieval for any model type, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
- SHA-3 Password Encryption: User passwords are encrypted using the SHA-3 algorithm for enhanced
security.
- Batch CSV Data Import: The system supports batch importing of initial data from CSV files, making it convenient to process large datasets in chunks.
- Factory Design Pattern: The factory pattern is used to quickly generate requests based on different requirements, enhancing system scalability and adaptability.
- JUnit 5: We used JUnit 5 to test our classes, it helps to ensure the correctness and robustness of our code.
